# Turk — History

## Project Context
- **Project:** online-banking-demo
- **User:** Brian
- **Stack:** C#/.NET (user-service, account-service, transaction-service, transfer-service), Python/FastAPI (ai-service, budget-service, chatbot-service), Go (event-processor), React/TypeScript (ui-app), Redis, Docker Compose, Azure AKS
- **Joined:** 2026-05-07
- **Focus:** Python service config fixes and cross-service consistency

## Learnings
- Azure Managed Redis (Balanced B0) uses port 10000 with TLS, not standard 6379
- Redis auth is dual-mode: AZURE_CLIENT_ID presence triggers Entra ID token auth (cloud/AKS), absence uses connection string password (local docker-compose)
- Go event-processor (src/event-processor/main.go) has the reference implementation for dual-mode Redis connection parsing
- .NET services use REDIS__CONNECTIONSTRING env var with format: host:10000,ssl=True,abortConnect=False
- Python services need to parse this .NET-style connection string into host/port/ssl components
- ConfigMap is at deploy/kustomize/base/configmap.yaml
- Brian's directive: all fixes must maintain docker-compose local development compatibility
- Transaction-service now calls account-service for balance validation before debit transactions
- InsufficientFundsException (src/transaction-service/Services/InsufficientFundsException.cs) is thrown by service layer, caught by controller → 400 Bad Request
- Both Cosmos and InMemory transaction service implementations validate balance via HTTP to account-service
- Transfer-service already had insufficient funds check in TransferService.cs; InMemoryTransferService was updated by Basher with same pattern
- InsufficientFundsAttempt events are published to Redis "banking-events" stream for anomaly/audit consumption
- Services:AccountService config is now set in transaction-service appsettings.json and docker-compose.yml
- Balance validation is fail-open: if account-service is unreachable, transaction proceeds with a warning log (graceful degradation)
- Secrets migrated from kubectl create to Azure KeyVault + CSI Secret Store driver (keyvault-secrets.tf, secret-provider-class.yaml)
- CSI driver uses kubelet managed identity (not workload identity) — requires separate RBAC role assignment on KeyVault
- JWT key now generated once via Terraform random_password, stored in KV — no longer regenerated every deploy
- SecretProviderClass syncs KV secrets into K8s Secret named banking-secrets with same keys — zero change to deployment env var references
- Placeholder pattern for secret-provider-class.yaml: REPLACE_WITH_KEYVAULT_NAME, REPLACE_WITH_TENANT_ID, REPLACE_WITH_AZURE_CLIENT_ID (sed + git checkout, same as configmap.yaml)
- Observability namespace keeps kubectl create for its single appinsights-connection-string secret (simpler than a second SecretProviderClass)
- key_vault_name output added to infra/cloud/outputs.tf for Taskfile consumption

### 2026-05-08 — KeyVault CSI Driver Secrets Migration

**Feature:** Migrated all banking-demo namespace secrets from kubectl create to Azure KeyVault + CSI Secret Store driver.

**Key architecture decisions:**
1. **Terraform manages all secrets** — 4 secrets (jwt-key, openai-endpoint, redis-connection-string, appinsights-connection-string) now created as `azurerm_key_vault_secret` resources in `keyvault-secrets.tf`
2. **JWT key is stable** — Generated once via `random_password`, stored in KeyVault. No longer regenerated on every deploy (eliminates session invalidation on redeploy)
3. **CSI driver syncs to K8s Secret** — `SecretProviderClass` maps KV secrets into a K8s Secret named `banking-secrets` with identical keys. Zero change to deployment manifest env var references
4. **Kubelet identity RBAC** — CSI driver uses AKS kubelet managed identity (not workload identity). Separate "Key Vault Secrets User" role assignment required on KeyVault for kubelet service principal
5. **Placeholder pattern** — Uses existing `sed`/`git checkout` pattern for REPLACE_WITH_KEYVAULT_NAME, REPLACE_WITH_TENANT_ID, REPLACE_WITH_AZURE_CLIENT_ID (same as configmap.yaml)
6. **Observability namespace keeps kubectl** — Simple `kubectl create secret` for single appinsights-connection-string (second CSI provider would be overkill)

**Key files created/modified:**
- `infra/cloud/keyvault-secrets.tf` — New Terraform for 4 KeyVault secrets + CSI RBAC
- `deploy/kustomize/base/secret-provider-class.yaml` — SecretProviderClass mapping KV → K8s Secret
- All 8 service deployments — Added CSI volume + volumeMount
- `infra/cloud/outputs.tf` — Added `key_vault_name` output
- `Taskfile.cloud.yml` — Simplified `_secrets:create` task, updated deploy pipeline

**Pattern:** CSI driver uses kubelet identity (not workload identity) — check kubelet service principal in Key Vault RBAC config, not workload identity webhook.
**Pattern:** JWT key is now stable. Applications that cache secrets at startup will persist across redeploys (feature, not bug).
